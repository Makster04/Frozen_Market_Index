## üßä COMPOSITE INDEX FEATURE ENGINEERING (Frozen Index)

To build the **Frozen Job Market Index**, follow this workflow:

### 1. **Standardize (Z-score)** the following variables:

| Direction        | Variable                                 |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| ‚¨ÜÔ∏è = More Frozen | Median Weeks Unemployed                  |
| ‚¨ÜÔ∏è = More Frozen | Unemployment Rate (U-3)                  |
| ‚¨ÜÔ∏è = More Frozen | Initial Jobless Claims                   |
| ‚¨ÜÔ∏è = More Frozen | U6‚ÄìU3 Spread                             |
| ‚¨áÔ∏è = More Frozen | Beveridge Ratio / OpeningsPerUnemployed  |
| ‚¨áÔ∏è = More Frozen | Quit Rate                                |
| ‚¨áÔ∏è = More Frozen | Quits-to-Layoffs Ratio                   |
| ‚¨áÔ∏è = More Frozen | Prime-Age Labor Force Participation Rate |
| ‚¨áÔ∏è = More Frozen | Prime-Age Employment-to-Population Ratio |
| ‚¨áÔ∏è = More Frozen | Real Wage Growth                         |
| ‚¨áÔ∏è = More Frozen | Avg Weekly Hours ‚Äì Total Private         |
| ‚¨áÔ∏è = More Frozen | Median Hourly Wage Growth ‚Äì 3MMA         |

### 2. **Combine** into a composite score:

* Option 1: Equal-weight **average**
* Option 2: **PCA** to extract dominant ‚Äúfreeze‚Äù signal

---

### 3. **Optional Enhancements**:

* Apply a **3‚Äì6 month rolling mean** to smooth volatility
* Normalize final index on a **0‚Äì1 scale**
* Classify into tiers:

  * **Loose**
  * **Balanced**
  * **Mild Freeze**
  * **Severe Freeze**

Great question ‚Äî now that you've finalized the **set of indicators for the Frozen Job Market Index**, you‚Äôre likely wondering:

> What should I do with all the **other indicators or engineered features** I calculated earlier but didn‚Äôt include in the final index?

---

## ‚úÖ Here are 5 smart ways to use your **extra features** outside the Frozen Index:

---

### 1. üß© **Build Thematic Sub-Indices**

Use your remaining features to create **focused indices** that offer deeper views into specific labor market dimensions:

| Index Name                  | What to Include                                      | Use Case                               |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `DistressIndex`             | Continued Claims, Long-term Unemployed %, U6 Rate    | Visualizing structural unemployment    |
| `CompensationPressureIndex` | Real Wage Growth, WeeklyHours\_Trend, MedianWage3MMA | Shows wage inflation and job intensity |
| `MobilityIndex`             | VoluntaryExitRatio, Total Separations, LayoffShock   | Measures worker confidence in quitting |

Use z-scores and `.mean(axis=1)` just like you did for the Frozen Index.

---

### 2. üìä **Use for Contextual Dashboards or Heatmaps**

Even if a variable isn‚Äôt in the core index, it can **enrich your dashboard**:

* Show heatmaps of current vs. historical percentiles
* Display ‚ÄúTop 3 signals tightening‚Äù or ‚ÄúCooling fastest‚Äù
* Track **leading indicators** ahead of turning points

---

### 3. üß† **Use as SHAP Features in a Classification Model**

Train a model to **predict freeze severity tiers** (`Loose`, `Balanced`, etc.), then use:

* All indicators as input features
* SHAP values to explain which variables **drive severity**

This adds interpretability and allows automated early warning.

---

### 4. ‚è±Ô∏è **Backtesting & Scenario Analysis**

Use the extra indicators to **test how sensitive the Frozen Index is** to:

* Wage growth shifts
* Jobless claims surges
* Participation collapses

You can build scenario tools: *"What if RealWageGrowth drops 2%?"*

---

### 5. üìÅ **Feature Library for Expansion**

Keep them in your dataset as a **feature library**:

* Ready for future index updates
* Available for new models (e.g. Recession Forecasting, Job Market Tightness Score)
* Valuable if segmenting by **industry**, **region**, or **demographic**

---

### ‚úÖ Summary Table:

| Action                             | Benefit                                |
| ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Sub-indices (e.g. `DistressIndex`) | Deeper insights into market segments   |
| Dashboard visuals                  | Enhanced storytelling + trend tracking |
| Model features (e.g. SHAP)         | Interpretation and automation          |
| Scenario testing                   | What-if planning and policy tools      |
| Feature library                    | Future-proofing your labor analytics   |

Economic Indicators not used that contriute to each of these graphs:

Ah ‚Äî thanks for the clarification! You're asking for **external lagging indicators (not already in your index)** that could be **drivers or contributors** to each index, like how **interest rates** affect all of them indirectly.

Here's a breakdown of **lagging indicators not used in your current formulas**, but which may significantly **influence each index**:

---

### üßä **1. Frozen Job Market Index**

**Measures**: Overall labor disruption (tightness + distress + wage/hours + confidence)

#### üîÅ Potential Lagging Contributors (Not Already Used):

* **Federal Funds Rate** ‚Üí Higher rates cool hiring and freeze market conditions
* **Personal Savings Rate** ‚Üí Drops may reflect financial strain or layoffs (https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/PMSAVE?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
* **Business Inventories** ‚Üí Rising inventories = demand slowdown = hiring freeze (https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/ISRATIO?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
* **Industrial Production** ‚Üí Slumps often precede labor freezes

---

### üî¥ **2. Labor Market Distress Index**

**Measures**: Job loss severity and unemployment pain

#### üîÅ Potential Lagging Contributors:

* **Bankruptcies (Business/Personal)** ‚Üí Often trail layoffs and deepen distress
* **Duration of Unemployment Insurance Exhaustion** ‚Üí Indicates persistent hardship
* **Temporary Help Services Employment** ‚Üí Weakness here often precedes broader layoffs (https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/TEMPHELPS)
* **Poverty Rate (Annual)** ‚Üí Lags but confirms structural labor stress

---

### üîµ **3. Labor Market Tightness Index**

**Measures**: Employer-side hiring difficulty, labor scarcity

#### üîÅ Potential Lagging Contributors:

* **Job Vacancy Duration (Time to Fill)** ‚Üí Longer time = tighter market
* **Labor Productivity** ‚Üí Weak productivity can exaggerate tightness effects
* **Corporate Profit Margins** ‚Üí Higher margins often correlate with aggressive hiring
* **ISM Services/Manufacturing Employment Indices** ‚Üí Hiring sentiment indicators

---

### üü° **4. Compensation Pressure Index**

**Measures**: Pressure to raise pay and hours

#### üîÅ Potential Lagging Contributors:

* **Employment Cost Index (ECI)** ‚Üí Tracks wages + benefits, lags but signals pressure
* **Unit Labor Costs** ‚Üí Show rising compensation burden for employers
* **Producer Price Index (PPI)** ‚Üí If rising, employers pass input costs to wages
* **Consumer Credit Growth** ‚Üí High borrowing may pressure wage demands (https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CCLACBW027SBOG#)

---

### üü¢ **5. Mobility & Voluntariness Index**

**Measures**: Confidence to switch jobs, quit voluntarily

#### üîÅ Potential Lagging Contributors:

* **Consumer Confidence Index** ‚Üí Higher confidence = more quits
* **Job Switching Premium (Wage Gap)** ‚Üí Lagging wage data on switchers vs stayers
* **Homeownership Rate** ‚Üí More mobility often linked to renters; homeownership can anchor
* **Retail Sales Growth** ‚Üí Reflects perceived household stability, enabling job changes
