Absolutely ‚Äî here is the **revised Frozen Job Market Index framework**, now reflecting that you're using:

* **CES0500000030**: *Average Hourly Earnings of Production and Nonsupervisory Employees: Total Private*
* **CPIAUCSL**: *Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers: All Items (YoY % Change)*
* Replacing `CIVPART` with `LNS11300060` (Prime-Age LFPR)

## üîí LABOR MARKET TIGHTNESS

**Indicators:**

| --------------------------------------------------- | ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Job Openings Rate                                   | JOLTS (`JTSJOL`)    | Total Nonfarm or by industry                               |

| Beveridge Ratio                                     | Derived             | = Job Openings / Unemployed                                |
| Openings per Hire                                   | Derived             | = Job Openings / Hires                                     |
| **Prime-Age Labor Force Participation Rate (LFPR)** | BLS (`LNS11300060`) | Clean measure of active labor engagement (25‚Äì54 year-olds) |

**Feature Engineering Ideas:**

* `OpeningsPerUnemployed = Job Openings / Unemployed`
* `OpeningsPerHire = Job Openings / Hires`
* `PrimeLFPR_Zscore = z-score(LNS11300060)`
* `ParticipationGap = Pre-pandemic Prime LFPR ‚Äì Current Prime LFPR`
* Normalize all using Z-scores or rolling averages

| **U-6 Unemployment Rate** | BLS (`U6RATE`)      | Includes underemployed & discouraged workers |
| Initial Jobless Claims    | FRED (`ICSA`)       | Weekly job loss inflow                       |
| Continued Jobless Claims  | FRED (`CCSA`)       | Persistent unemployment inflow               |
| Median Weeks Unemployed   | BLS (`LNS13008275`) | Duration signal of unemployment hardship     |
| Long-term Unemployed (%)  | Derived             | = UEMP27OV / UNEMPLOY                        |

**Feature Engineering Ideas:**

* `Unemployed27Share = UEMP27OV / UNEMPLOY`
* `Lagged_Claims = Rolling average of ICSA over 4‚Äì8 weeks`
* `MedianWeeks_Zscore`
* `U6_U3_Spread = U6RATE - UNRATE`
* Combine into a `DistressIndex` using PCA or averaging

## üîÅ LABOR MOBILITY / CONFIDENCE

**Indicators:**

| Indicator              | Source           | Notes                                       |
| ---------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Quit Rate              | JOLTS (`JTSQUR`) | Lower values suggest fear of switching jobs |
| Quits-to-Layoffs Ratio | Derived          | = Quits / Layoffs                           |
| Layoffs and Discharges | JOLTS (`JTSLDL`) | Indicator of involuntary exits              |

**Feature Engineering Ideas:**

* `QuitsToLayoffs = Quits / Layoffs`
* `LayoffShock = % change in Layoffs MoM`
* Normalize using rolling z-scores or trend slopes

## üí∏ COMPENSATION & PARTICIPATION SIGNALS

**Indicators:**

| Indicator                                           | Source                | Notes                                                  |
| --------------------------------------------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| AHE: Production & Nonsupervisory (Total Private)    | CES (`CES0500000030`) | Nominal wages for majority of working population       |

**Feature Engineering Ideas:**

* `AHE_YoY = df['AHE'].pct_change(periods=12) * 100`
* `RealWageGrowth = AHE_YoY - CPI_YoY`
* `WageGrowth_YoY = AHE_YoY`
* `PrimeAgeEPOP_Zscore`
* `PrimeLFPR_Trend = df['PrimeLFPR'] - df['PrimeLFPR'].shift(12)`
* Combine into a `ParticipationIndex` if desired

## üßä COMPOSITE INDEX FEATURE ENGINEERING (Frozen Index)

To build the **Frozen Job Market Index**, follow this workflow:

### 1. **Standardize (Z-score)** the following variables:

| Direction        | Variable                                 |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| ‚¨ÜÔ∏è = More Frozen | Median Weeks Unemployed                  |
| ‚¨ÜÔ∏è = More Frozen | Unemployment Rate (U-3)                  |
| ‚¨ÜÔ∏è = More Frozen | Initial Jobless Claims                   |
| ‚¨ÜÔ∏è = More Frozen | U6‚ÄìU3 Spread                             |
| ‚¨áÔ∏è = More Frozen | Beveridge Ratio / OpeningsPerUnemployed  |
| ‚¨áÔ∏è = More Frozen | Quit Rate                                |
| ‚¨áÔ∏è = More Frozen | Quits-to-Layoffs Ratio                   |
| ‚¨áÔ∏è = More Frozen | Prime-Age Labor Force Participation Rate |
| ‚¨áÔ∏è = More Frozen | Prime-Age Employment-to-Population Ratio |
| ‚¨áÔ∏è = More Frozen | Real Wage Growth                         |

---

### 2. **Combine** into a composite score:

* Option 1: Equal-weight **average**
* Option 2: **PCA** to extract dominant ‚Äúfreeze‚Äù signal

---

### 3. **Optional Enhancements**:

* Apply a **3‚Äì6 month rolling mean** to smooth volatility
* Normalize final index on a **0‚Äì1 scale**
* Classify into tiers:

  * **Loose**, **Balanced**, **Mild Freeze**, **Severe Freeze**
