# Create the Indicies

To construct each of these labor market sub-indices ‚Äî **Labor Tightness**, **Labor Distress**, **Mobility & Confidence**, and **Compensation Pressure** ‚Äî you‚Äôll follow a consistent **4-step methodology** for each:

---

### üîß GENERAL STEPS TO BUILD EACH INDEX:

1. **Normalize Indicators**
   Use **Z-scores** or **percentage changes** to standardize across units (e.g., rates vs. counts).

2. **Align Directionality**
   Ensure all components move in the same direction with respect to tightness/distress/etc. (e.g., higher = tighter).

3. **Aggregate Indicators**
   Combine via:

   * Mean of Z-scores (simple, interpretable)
   * PCA (captures primary common signal)
   * Weighted sum (if domain knowledge suggests)

4. **Optional: Smooth or Transform**
   Apply rolling average (e.g., 3-month) or exponential smoothing for stability.
